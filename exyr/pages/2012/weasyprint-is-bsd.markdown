title: WeasyPrint is now BSD-licensed

    We just changed [WeasyPrint](http://weasyprint.org/)’s license from
    AGPL to BSD.


A lot has happend in [WeasyPrint](http://weasyprint.org/) since its
[first release](/2011/weasyprint/) a few months ago. The latest version
is focused on better page breaks. The details are in the
[changelog](https://github.com/Kozea/WeasyPrint/blob/master/CHANGES).

Features are great, but the biggest news is the change of license. The
AGPL is too restrictive for many, and the benefits for us were unclear
(in my opinion.) Starting from this version, WeasyPrint is made
available under a BSD license. Hopefully this will allow more people
to use it.

As usual, any feedback is appreciated. The project’s [mailing-list](
http://weasyprint.org/community/) is now up and running.
