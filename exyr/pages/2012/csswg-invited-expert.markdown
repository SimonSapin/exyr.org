title: Invited Expert at W3C’s CSSWG

summary: |
    I just joined [W3C’s *CSS Working Group*](http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/)
    as an *Invited Expert*.

Making WeasyPrint lead me to the CSS specifications and
the [www-style](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/) mailing-list
a lot. For almost a year now I’ve been asking questions about the specs,
sometimes reporting bugs and suggesting changes.

A few weeks ago at the most unexpected of times, I got an invitation from
[Daniel Glazman](http://www.glazman.org/weblog/) himself.
It’s now official: I’ve joined the [CSS Working Group](
http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/) at W3C! This means that I’ll get to work on
CSS specifications. Which is … a bit like before, but the difference is huge
in terms of recognition.
