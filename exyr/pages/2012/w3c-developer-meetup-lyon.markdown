This is a  bit last minute, but I’m giving a talk tonight in the Lyon
city hall for the
[W3C Developer Meetup](http://www.w3.org/2012/10/TPAC/meetup-Lyon.html).
The title is ”<em>WeasyPrint: bring the web to PDF and paper</em>” but
(spoiler!) it’s also about W3C and how we got there.

See you tonight!
