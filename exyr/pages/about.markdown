title: About

Hi, I’m Simon Sapin.
I work on [Servo](https://servo.org/) at [Mozilla Research](https://research.mozilla.org/),
previously on [WeasyPrint](http://weasyprint.org) at [Kozea](https://www.kozea.fr/).
I’ve contributed to, maintained, and created a number of other open-source projects,
mostly in [Python](https://python.org/) and [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).
I’ve also contributed to web standards
at [W3C’s CSS Working Group](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/).

I’m *SimonSapin* on [GitHub](https://github.com/SimonSapin),
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/SimonSapin),
and IRC (<i>#whatwg</i> @ Freenode, <i>#servo</i> @ Mozilla IRC).
Email to *contact* at this domain also works.
