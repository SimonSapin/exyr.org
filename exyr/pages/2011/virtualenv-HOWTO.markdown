title: virtualenv HOWTO
published: 2011-06-10
summary: Slides for an introduction to virtualenv and pip I gave recently.


I recently gave a presentation to my co-workers about pip and virtualenv,
and generally how to manage dependencies in Python.

Here are the slides, just in case it’s interesting to someone else.
They’re made with Paul Rouget’s [DZSlides](http://paulrouget.com/dzslides/).
It’s a single HTML5 file with some CSS3 and Javascript inlined, [view
the source](slides.html) to learn more.
