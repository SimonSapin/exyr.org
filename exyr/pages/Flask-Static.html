summary:
    Some web hosts only serve static files and do not allow you to run code on
    their servers. Or maybe they do, but not in your favorite programming language.
    Even when you could run Flask on a server, a 5 pages website that changes
    twice a year should be fast without requiring a Python process constantly
    sitting on a server and eating precious RAM.
    

Directly writing HTML as it will be served is possible, but tedious and
repetitive at best. And you’ll have to go through every page when you fix a
typo in that header tomorrow. We have better tools nowadays.

Many tools exist that allow you to generate a static website from a set of
“source” files, but most need to be run after each small change that you
want to see in your web browser. We could have a dependency mechanism and a
script that watches modifications times or uses `inotify` to build as needed,
but this is getting overly complex.

A better solution is to use the same tools we have for dynamic web application,
run the development server with auto-reloading when editing, and take a
static snapshot for uploading. This is what Flask-Static does.
