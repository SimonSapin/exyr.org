title: About

Hi, I’m Simon Sapin and this is my personal website. I’m a computer science
student from *INSA Lyon* in France, currently at the *University of Tokyo* in
Japan.

Maybe tomorrow I’ll feel like telling more here.

See also [other websites I made](http://simonsapin.info/en/); and some
[source code on github](https://github.com/SimonSapin), including this
website’s.
