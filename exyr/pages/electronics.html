Thanks to Moore’s law, we can nowadays program computers in high-level,
dynamic languages and not worry about performance until it starts being a
problem.

At the other extreme of computing, you have *microcontrollers*. With as little
as one kilo-byte of memory, every wasted byte counts.
You’re stuck with C/C++ at best, and can’t use
the fancy stuff of functional programming. But having a better understanding
of what is going on almost down to the logical gate and the transistor, 
as well as interacting with the physical world makes it just as interesting.
