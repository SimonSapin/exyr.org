    <p>I was at PyConFR in Paris on September 15th and 16th.
I <a href="http://www.pycon.fr/2012/schedule/presentation/16/">gave a talk</a>
on <a href="http://weasyprint.org/">WeasyPrint</a> and CSS for print.</p>
<p><strong>Update 2012-09-12</strong>:
I made <a href="PyConFR_2012_schedule.pdf">a PDF version</a> of
<a href="http://www.pycon.fr/2012/schedule/">the schedule</a> for printing, of course
dogfooding WeasyPrint. There is <a href="print.css">a bit of CSS</a> to remove irrelevant
navigation links, fix some brokenness of the original page, and generally
make it look nice on A4. You can regenerate the same PDF with:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>weasyprint http://www.pycon.fr/2012/schedule/ PyConFR_2012_schedule.pdf <span class="se">\</span>
  -s http://exyr.org/2012/weasyprint-at-pyconfr/print.css
</pre></div>


<p><strong>Update 2012-09-17</strong>:
I think the talk was a success although I forgot a few details. The slides
are below (or <a href="embedder.html#slides.html">fullscreen</a>), with notes
paraphrasing what I said “on stage”.
The talk and slides were in French (this is PyCon<strong>FR</strong>,
after all) but you, dear international reader, get the English ones.</p>
