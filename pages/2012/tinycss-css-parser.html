    <p>I’m happy to announce the first release of tinycss!
I captured it best in the README, so here it is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>tinycss</em> is a complete yet simple CSS parser for Python. It supports the
full syntax and error handling for CSS 2.1 as well as some CSS 3 modules:</p>
<ul>
<li>Selectors 3 (can also find matching elements in a <a href="http://lxml.de/">lxml</a>
  document)</li>
<li>CSS Color 3</li>
<li>CSS Paged Media 3</li>
</ul>
<p>It is designed to be easy to extend for new CSS modules and syntax.</p>
<p>Quick facts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Free software: BSD licensed</li>
<li>Compatible with Python 2.6+ and 3.x</li>
<li>Latest documentation <a href="http://packages.python.org/tinycss/">on python.org</a></li>
<li>Source, issues and pull requests
  <a href="https://github.com/SimonSapin/tinycss/">on Github</a></li>
<li>Releases <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/tinycss">on PyPI</a></li>
<li>Install with <code>pip install tinycss</code></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It now replaces <a href="http://packages.python.org/cssutils/">cssutils</a> in both
<a href="http://weasyprint.org/">WeasyPrint</a> and <a href="http://cairosvg.org/">CairoSVG</a>.
Sorry, Christof!</p>
<p>cssutils has served us very well. It allowed me to skip entire chapters
of the CSS specifications when I started WeasyPrint a year ago, and get
started quickly. The source is quite readable and well documented.
cssutils is overall a very nice project.</p>
<p>However, patching cssutils to add support for the CSS 3 <code>@page</code> syntax
turned out to be more painful than − I think − it should have been.
The parser is somehow interleaved with the various data structures.
cssutils also has some hard-to-fix performance issues.
(Accessing a selector goes through the whole stylesheet every time to
look for <code>@namespace</code> rules.)</p>
<p>So, as thankful as I am to <a href="http://cthedot.de/">Christof Höke</a> for his
work cssutils and for his support and collaboration with me, it was time
for something simpler.</p>
<p>I started working on tinycss with a very clear idea of what I wanted:
keep the implementation straightforward, and make it easy to extend for
new syntax. After a few days of hacking I had a mostly working prototype that
was already quite fast. I ended up adding optional
<a href="http://cython.org/">Cython</a> accelerators. The process of profiling
and optimizing for speed was very interesting, but it is a whole other story.</p>
<p>This <a href="https://github.com/SimonSapin/tinycss/blob/master/tinycss/tests/speed.py">micro-benchmark</a>
(parsing and traversing a small stylesheet 20 times on my laptop)
probably does not mean much, but the results certainly look nice:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>$ python -m tinycss.tests.speed
tinycss + speedups        <span class="m">119</span> ms
tinycss WITHOUT speedups  <span class="m">174</span> ms  <span class="m">1</span>.46x
cssutils                  <span class="m">928</span> ms  <span class="m">7</span>.80x
</pre></div>


<p>As for extending, adding syntax is a matter of writing a subclass of
<code>CSS21Parser</code> and overriding some methods. In fact, CSS 3 modules in
tinycss are implemented precisely this way. Doing so ensure that extending
is viable, and that the required hooks are included.</p>
<p>I then spent a lot more time getting the details right, polishing the API,
writing documentation, and updating WeasyPrint to use this new parser.
I’ve now got to a point where I am very satisfied with the project.
From this 0.1 version, I will try not to change the user API without a
good reason. (Although such reasons will probably come up sooner or later :)</p>
<p>For future versions I plan on adding parser support for
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-mediaqueries/">Media Queries</a> and
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-namespace/">CSS Namespaces</a>, as well as maybe
adding the selectors that are missing in
<a href="http://lxml.de/cssselect.html">lxml.cssselect</a>.</p>
<p>I hope you’ll like cssutils too. Keep me posted if you do anything interesting
with it (or any of my projects!)
Have a look at the <a href="http://packages.python.org/tinycss/">tinycss documentation</a> and go from there.</p>
