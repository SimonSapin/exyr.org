    <p><strong>This is, of course, solely my personal opinion.</strong></p>
<p>The Mozilla Blog published <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2015/10/07/proposed-principles-for-content-blocking/">Proposed Principles for Content Blocking</a>.
One of these proposed principles is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Content Neutrality:</strong> Content blocking software should focus on addressing potential
user needs  (such as on performance, security, and privacy)
instead of blocking specific types of content (such as advertising).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I disagree. I absolutely want to block all advertising.</p>
<p>What makes browsing the Web without ad-blocking such a horrible experience
is not just the load times, the malwares, and the tracking
(although these things <em>are</em> horrible).
It’s also the pop-overs masking actual content, the distracting animations,
and the auto-playing videos that start blasting sound without consent.</p>
<p>But even more “reasonable” ads are fundamentally about competing for your attention
and misleading you away from whatever you’re currently looking at.
To re-use a term from email spam, they are <em>unsolicited</em>.</p>
<p>Even if it’s perfectly performant, secure, and privacy-respecting
<strong>I want to block all unsolicited content</strong>.</p>
