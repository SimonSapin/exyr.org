    <p>The workflow for writing software typically goes like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make some changes in the source code</li>
<li>Run the program, typically a test suite</li>
<li>Watch the output</li>
<li>Rinse and repeat</li>
</ul>
<p>For me the second step means hitting <em>ALT-Tab</em> to switch from my text editor
to a terminal window, then the <em>up</em> arrow and <em>Enter</em> to re-run the last
command. After that, <em>ALT-Tab</em> again to go back to the text editor.</p>
<p>This is way too much repetitive work. It can, and thus should be automated.
What we want is a script that will watch source files, and run another script
when they change. We could poll the modification time of each file, but
that is a bit inefficient.</p>
<p>On Linux, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inotify">inotify</a> can have the kernel,
well, notify you whenever a file changes. There are a
<a href="https://github.com/peterbe/python-gorun">number</a>
<a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyZen/">of</a>
<a href="https://github.com/mynyml/watchr">projects</a> doing fancy things with inotify,
but it can be much more simple.</p>
<p>I have the following in an <code>inotifyrun</code> script:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="ch">#!/bin/sh</span>
<span class="nv">FORMAT</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="k">$(</span><span class="nb">echo</span> -e <span class="s2">&quot;\033[1;33m%w%f\033[0m written&quot;</span><span class="k">)</span>
<span class="s2">&quot;</span><span class="nv">$@</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span>
<span class="k">while</span> inotifywait -qre close_write --format <span class="s2">&quot;</span><span class="nv">$FORMAT</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span> .
<span class="k">do</span>
    <span class="s2">&quot;</span><span class="nv">$@</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span>
<span class="k">done</span>
</pre></div>


<p>When I run it with <code>inotifyrun attest</code> the script first runs my test suite
once with <a href="http://packages.python.org/Attest/">Attest</a>, then block until
a file is written in the current directory or a sub-directory. When that
happens, it runs the test suite again and repeats the loop.
I used Attest as an example but it can be any command, optionally
with arguments.</p>
<p>Your kernel probably has inotify already, but you may need to install a
<code>inotify-tools</code> package to get the command-line tools.</p>
<h4>Web development</h4>
<p>When building stuff for the web, you often test in a web browser rather than
in a terminal. Refresh a web page instead of running a script.</p>
<p>So, how can this script help? We need to instruct the browser to refresh
a page. As usual, Unix has a tool for that. <code>xdotool</code> does X11 magic to
simulate mouse and keyboard actions. It can also search among open windows.
Let’s combine these with inotify:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>inotifyrun xdotool search --name &#39;Chromium&#39; key F5
</pre></div>


<p>Ta-da! Your browser reloads the current page as soon as you hit <em>Save</em> in your
text editor. Unfortunately though, Firefox doesn’t seem to respond to xdotool.</p>
<p><strong>Update 2012-07-19</strong>: one day the command above just stopped working for me.
It turns out it only sends F5 to the <em>first</em> window that matches the search.
Sometimes that happens to be one the reloads on F5, sometimes not.
The new command below fixes this: <code>--window %@</code> sends the key to all matching
windows.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>xdotool search --name Chromium key --window %@ F5
</pre></div>


<h4>How it works</h4>
<p><code>inotifywait</code> watch all files in <code>.</code>, the current directory, recursively with
the <code>-r</code> option. <code>-q</code> suppresses a warning saying that the setup may be long
if you have many files, but that’s not a problem in practice.
The <code>echo -e</code> trick is required to have the color codes interpreted.
<code>%w%f</code> in the format string is replaced by the filename that was just
written to.</p>
<p>inotify can tell us about many events (any kind of operation on files)
but with <code>-e close_write</code> we say we’re only interested by files being closed
after they were written to. This is better than any <code>write</code> event because
it means you editor has finished writing the file.</p>
<p>Please let me know if you think this can be improved!</p>
